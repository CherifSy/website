Notations
---------

    Some note about notation...

- Variable: ``$ONE_TYPE_OF_VARIABLE``
- Variable: ``<another type of variable``
- Literal: ``copy_me_exactly``
- Code-block:

.. code:: text

    #! /usr/bin/env python
    # This is a code block.
    # Most of the time you can copy this code and run it
    # Where it 'goes' and how to run it should make sense based on context
    print('Hello world!')

You can copy the above script into a file named ``<whatever you want>.py`` and
run it with ``python <whatever you want>.py``.

.. note::

    Variables are annotated ``$ALL_UPPERCASE`` or ``<in brackets>`` with expressive names.
        - These can usually be any value like ``foo``, ``bar``, ``baz`` or ``my name``.
        - The constraints on what a variable can be should be made clear.

    Literals are just ``in code font``. Copy them exactly as they are.

    If you have any questions about ambiguity, ask!.

If you are taking the course online exclusively you will need to run a Virtual
Machine on your own computer. For more information jump down to the
:ref:`linux_at_home` section of this lesson.

If you are taking DOBC in person we are able to offer you personal credentials
to the OSU OSL Cloud. More information in the :ref:`linux_at_lecture` section.
