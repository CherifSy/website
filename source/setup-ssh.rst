Setting up SSH
==============

Secure Shell (SSH) provides a secure channel to access a Linux machine remotely via command line.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Windows doesn't come with an ssh client natively, however you can download and install `PuTTY`_ to give you a nice SSH
client.

Linux and Mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're already running Linux or have a Mac laptop, you already have an ssh installed. For the Mac, simply open up
the Terminal.app. For Linux, you can use something like Gnome Terminal, Terminator or xterm to name a few.
