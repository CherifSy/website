What *DevOps* is
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **DevOps is the field which takes skills from Software Development and
    Operations Engineering to create and run applications more effectively.**

.. note::

    TLDR: Development (writing software) + Operations (running servers).

    In a pre-DevOps world the jobs of Devs and Ops were seperate:

    - There was a clearly defined and relatively standardized interface between
      the two.
    - Workflows were slower, meaning ther was more time to troubleshoot and
      debug.

    In a Post-DevOps world we have a new hybrid job:

    - Software is released faster via **Agile Development**.
    - Larger scale services means companies need many identical servers,
      creating **Configuration Management**.
    - Devs need to know ops for testing purposes and to anticipate deployment
      issues.
    - Ops need to know development to minimize wasted resources and to improve
      security.


What *DevOps BootCamp* is
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Couch to DevOps in 1 school year**

DOBC is a free education program offering:
    - Mentors working with DevOps tools and concepts
    - Personal Apprenticeship
    - Hands-on training and lectures
    - Free and Open Source course materials!

.. note::

    DOBC will meet about twice monthly for in-person lectures and hands-on
    activities, but all course materials are avaliable for those who are
    self-guided and want to work ahead.

    Check the schedule for more information.


What DOBC is *not*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DevOps BootCamp is not:
    - An OSU class for credit
    - A Student job

.. note::

    DOBC is a free course for all types of students. If you are attending
    online, in person, or just want help on IRC.

    While the course does not go on your transcript it can go on your Resume
    which is important as well. The many benefits of DOBC will be discussed and
    brought up throughout the course.


Why DOBC Exists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DOBC was created because:
    - The OSU OSL integrated with the school of EECS.
    - We want to bridge the “Skills Gap”.
    - We want to help students meet Company’s demands and expectations of
      students.
    - To build a DevOps Learning community.

.. note::

    The OSU Open Source Lab has become part of the OSU School of EECS so we
    have created this program in an effort to contribute directly to the
    community by sharing our knowledge in a useful and constructive way.

    In teaching OSU Students and local community members we hope to give more
    people a chance to be employed in the growing and exciting industry around
    DevOps.


What You Will do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will Learn:
    - Linux systems
    - Networking
    - Software development
    - Tools and why they matter

You will Build:
    - Functioning applications on the cloud
    - Cloud infrastructures

.. note::

    DOBC focuses on teaching conceptual understanding over wrought memorization
    of commands to get a particular job done. This means that we will be
    addressing the why and what am I doing much more often than the how and
    what do I type.

    The tools of industry change every year, the way we tackle problems changes
    much more slowly. Learning how problems are solved is much more useful than
    knowing how fires are put out.


The Teachers of DOBC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- OSL Students
- OSL Faculty
- Guest Speakers from Industry
- You!

.. note::

    The OSL employs ~20 part-time students who are all equipped to answer
    questions and teach this course. Many of your lecturer’s and activity
    helpers were once DOBC students and are now gainfully employed by the OSL.

    We regularly have guest speakers in to talk about a specific topic. While
    these may not be as interactive as other lessons meeting and talking with
    industry experts is a valuable experience you should take.

    We also encourage asking questions and students contributing to the course.
    If you learned something interesting share it with your peers and during
    class. At the very least ask questions, you’re not the only one.
