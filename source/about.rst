What is DevOps?
---------------

**DevOps** is a hybrid of skills from both Software Development (Dev) and
Computer Operations (ops) intended to meet the unique demands of `cloud
computing`_. *Software Developer* and *Systems Administrator* are no longer
mutually exclusive job titles. Devs need more ops knowledge to understand how
their application will run in the real world. Admins need more dev
knowledge to design infrastructure that fit an app's needs efficiently and
effectively. To top it off site reliability engineers and many modern
security roles require at least a little background in both development and
operations.

Purpose of DevOps BootCamp
--------------------------

DevOps BootCamp is an OSU Open Source Lab program dedicated to teaching core
software development and systems operation skills. The program is free and open
to any interested OSU students, community member, and online go-getter. DevOps
BootCamp provides a comprehensive Open Source education that is outside the
scope of regular Linux Users Group meetings and OSU Coursework.

What Students Get
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration.
* Professional connections in the software industry.
* A welcoming environment to start learning, for those who have always wanted
  to learn about software development and systems administration but were never
  sure where to start.
* An opportunity to fill in knowledge gaps for self-taught coders or sysadmins.
* The skills to build and deploy Open Source software, or contribute to
  existing projects

What the Open Source Lab Gets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The OSL gets a larger pool of candidates to recommend to companies
  interested in recruiting students.
* The OSL gets to work with a wider variety of students, benefiting its status
  as part of the school of EECS.
* The Open Source Community gets more project contributors.

Target Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our goal is to make the DevOps BootCamp program accessible to students and
community members from all backgrounds. Students should:

* Want to learn.
* Be willing to ask questions
* Be open to setting apart time to play with the tools you'll be learning about in the class.

Policies
--------

Attendance
~~~~~~~~~~

Attendance is not mandatory but highly suggested to get the most out of DBOC;
We will not spend class time reviewing material for those who skip a lecture
and each classes curriculum will build on what you learned the previous
session. All curriculum will be available online before and after class
sessions to get caught up.

BootCamp mentors will be available at scheduled times outside of regular
classes to help answer any questions about the training program's content. If
you attend a lesson and don't understand something then you are encouraged to
ask that question during the meeting since others are likely have the same
question.

Laptops
~~~~~~~

As the course progresses, you will need a laptop. We hope and recommend that
you decide to set up your laptop to dual-boot to Linux as the course
progresses, but it is not required. If you don't own a laptop and are an OSU
student you can check out a laptop from the OSU Library for at least 24 hours
at a time.

As long as your laptop is new enough to boot from USB and connect to a
wireless network the exact specifications do not matter. You will be provided
with a remote virtual machine with which to do all class projects.

If you are not an OSU student and do not have access to a working laptop,
contact the DevOps BootCamp (`email devopsbootcamp`_) organizers and they will
see whether one can be loaned out to you.
